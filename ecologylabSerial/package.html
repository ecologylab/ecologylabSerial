        <p>ecologylabSerial contains libraries necessary for
        cross-platform serial communication. The main code here is
        RXTX, an implementation (more or less) of the Java COMM
        API. This setup includes only RXTX version 2.1, which is in
        the namespace gnu.io. <a href=

        <p>Instructions for setup on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
        can be found in the install directory. The necessary JAR
        file is located in the lib directory. It is not necessary
        to add this JAR file to your Java installation, but you
        will need to put it on the build path of any project using
        RXTX.</p>
